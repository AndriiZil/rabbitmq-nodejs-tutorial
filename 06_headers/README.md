# Headers Exchange

* In RabbitMQ, a "headers" exchange is one of the exchange types available for message routing. 
Unlike other exchange types like direct, topic, or fanout, which use routing keys to determine message routing,
a headers exchange relies on message headers for routing decisions.

* In a headers exchange, messages are routed to queues based on a set of headers and their values, rather than routing keys. 
A message is considered a match for a queue if its headers match the criteria specified for that queue. 
This makes headers exchanges very flexible and suitable for scenarios where routing decisions are complex 
and need to be based on various header attributes.
